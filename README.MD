#Optimium Theme
The optium theme for ghost is based on the willsong theme and modified for both better looks and maximum speed without losing out on anything else. Google insights gives ~~a 100% for speed (Unless images are not optimized)~~ (Temporary false. Minor optimization issue.) and user experience which is higher than both casper and willsong.

##Features

 - Disqus comments
 - Non-intrusive google ads
 - Menu
 - Parallax Effect on header
 - Responsive
 - Optimized
 - Frequent updates on GitHub
 - Optimized for Social Media
 - etc...

 ##Important!
 ~~It is important to note that the theme is updated very often so make sure that you have the latest version from time to time.~~

 #Developement Ceased
Developement has been ceased until futher notice (probably forever) because it is finished and I am not entirely
satisfied with the final product. With that in mind, I will continue making ghost themes.
